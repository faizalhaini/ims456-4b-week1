<b>The Tombak Agung</b>
<p style="text-align:right; ">The Tombak Agung consists of a pair of long lances, one with a bamboo leaf-shaped blade, another with a five-curved blade which represent religion, knowledge and personality values as well as the sovereignty of the Malay society and the nation. The overall motif on the shaft of the spear is adapted from a design of a dome to symbolise<br> UiTM as a font of knowledge, disseminating and receiving knowledge according to the law of knowledge towards creating the good and banishing the evil based on religious teachings particularly among the undergraduates, all for the religion, the race and the nation.</p>

<u>The Mace</u>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Mace of Universiti Teknologi MARA is in the form of a Malay keris (dagger) known as the Keris Agung and accompanied by a pair of long lances known as the Tombak Agung. Both items symbolise UiTM as an institution of higher learning for bumiputeras which is unique, strong and pure.</p>

<i>The Keris Agung</i>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A sheathed Keris Agung symbolises the strength and the wholeness of the Malays. The motif on the Keris Agung is apt for the meaning and the aim of its creation. The motif represents the King, Seri Paduka Baginda Yang di-Pertuan Agung as the Chancellor of UiTM, and at the same time representing UiTM as a unique Bumiputera institution of higher learning.</p>
